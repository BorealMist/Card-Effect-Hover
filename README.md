This simple hover card effect is still a work in progress, just uploaded this part to track the different versions.
Objectives:
  1. Fill all the cards
  2. Add shadow effects to the images and texts following the same event handling as the borders of the cards.
  3. Add effect on click.

Original design based on Hyperplexed hover effect.
